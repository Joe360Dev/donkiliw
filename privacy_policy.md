# Privacy Policy for Donkiliw

**Last Update: July 31, 2025, 01:23 PM GMT**

## Introduction
Donkiliw is a mobile application developed by Joe360Dev ("we," "us," or "our") that allows users to browse and search Bamanakan hymns and save hymn images to their device’s gallery. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we handle user data. This Privacy Policy explains how Donkiliw accesses, uses, and handles data in accordance with Google Play Store policies and applicable laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

## Data We Collect
Donkiliw **does not collect or share any personal or sensitive user data**. The app operates locally on your device and does not transmit any data to our servers or third parties. Specifically:

- **Images Saved to Gallery**: Donkiliw allows you to save hymn images to your device’s gallery. These images are processed locally on your device and are not sent off-device or shared with us or any third parties. This process is ephemeral, meaning the app only accesses the image data temporarily to save it to your device’s gallery as requested.
- **No Personal Data**: We do not collect personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, location, device identifiers), financial information, or any other sensitive data.
- **No Account Creation**: Donkiliw does not require user accounts or authentication, so no account-related data is collected.

## Permissions
To save hymn images to your device’s gallery, Donkiliw may request the following permission on Android devices running Android 12L or lower (API 32 or lower):

- **Storage Permission (WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)**: This permission is required to save images to your device’s gallery on Android 10 to 12L (API 29–32). On Android 13 and above (API 33+), no permissions are required, as the app uses the Media Store API to save images.

We only request permissions necessary for the app’s functionality, and we do not use these permissions to collect or share any data.

## Third-Party Services
Donkiliw uses third-party libraries (e.g., `image_gallery_saver_plus`, `sqflite`, `provider`) to provide its functionality. These libraries operate locally on your device and **do not collect or share user data** in our implementation. We ensure all third-party code complies with Google Play Developer Program policies.

## Data Sharing
Donkiliw **does not share any user data** with third parties, including service providers, advertisers, or analytics providers, as no user data is collected or transmitted.

## Data Security
We prioritize the security of your data. Since Donkiliw processes images locally and does not transmit data off-device, there is no risk of data interception or unauthorized access by us or third parties.

## Your Data Rights
Under applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), you have rights over your personal data, including the right to access, modify, or delete it. Since Donkiliw does not collect or store personal data, there is no personal data for us to provide or delete. Images saved to your device’s gallery are under your control, and you can delete them using your device’s gallery app.

## Children’s Privacy
Donkiliw is not targeted at children under 13 years of age and does not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child under 13 has used the app, please contact us, and we will take appropriate steps.

## Ads
Donkiliw **does not contain ads** or use third-party ad networks.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the app or by updating the policy on our website. The updated policy will be effective as of the date posted.
